Notes from the book `The Go Programming Language` Alan A. A. Donovan and Brian W. Kernighan. 

## Intro

Go is a general purpose language.

Go has automatic memory management or garbage collection.

Go is a replacement for untyped scripting languages. It balances expressiveness with safety. 

From C: expression syntax, control-flow statements, basic data types, call-by-value parameter passing, pointers. Also, efficient machine code and cooperate well with the OS abstraction.

Simplicity is the key to good software.

Simplicity of design ensures stability, security and coherence.

There is no class and class hierarchies. Complex objects behaviors are created from simpler ones by composition, not inheritance.

Relationship between concrete and abstract types (interfaces) is implicit, so a concrete type may satisfy an interface that the type's author was unaware of.

`go` tool is used for compilation, testing, benchmarking, linting, documentation, etc.
