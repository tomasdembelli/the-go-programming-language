Notes from the book [`The Go Programming Language`](https://www.gopl.io/) Alan A. A. Donovan and Brian W. Kernighan. 

[Source code](https://github.com/adonovan/gopl.io) for the code examples.

## Intro

Go is a general purpose language.

Go has automatic memory management or garbage collection.

Go is a replacement for untyped scripting languages. It balances expressiveness with safety. 

From C: expression syntax, control-flow statements, basic data types, call-by-value parameter passing, pointers. Also, efficient machine code and cooperate well with the OS abstraction.

Simplicity is the key to good software.

Simplicity of design ensures stability, security and coherence.

There is no class and class hierarchies. Complex objects behaviors are created from simpler ones by composition, not inheritance.

Relationship between concrete and abstract types (interfaces) is implicit, so a concrete type may satisfy an interface that the type's author was unaware of.

`go` tool is used for compilation, testing, benchmarking, linting, documentation, etc.


## Tutorial

Go is a compiled language. The Go toolchain converts a source program and the things it depends on into instructions in the native machine language of a computer.

Go natively handles Unicode.

Go code is organized into packages. A package consists of one or more .go source files in a single directory.

Package `main` is special. It defines a `standalone executable program`, not a library. The `main` function is special, it is where `execution of the program begins`. 

**Whatever `main` does is what the program does**.

A program will not compile if there are missing imports or if there are unnecessary ones.

The order of declarations (type, constants, variables) does not matter.

Multiple statements must be separated via semicolon if they are on the same line.

Comments begin with `//`.

Short variable declaration `:=` declares variables and gives them appropriate types based on the initializer values.

For loop is the only loop statement. All three parts are _optional_.
```
for initialization; condition; post {
// zero or more statements
}
```
Initialization must be a _simple statement_: short variable declaration, an increment or assignment statement, or a function call.

Go does not permit unused local variables.

Blank identifier: `_` underscore. It is used whenever syntax requires a variable name but program logic does not.
```
for _, thing := range sliceOfThings {
// some statements
}
```

Variable declaration:
```
s := ""         // cannot be used outside of a function (at package level)
var s string
var s = "" 
var s string = ""
```

A map provides a constant-time operations to store, retrieve for an item in the set.
The map key can be any type whose values can be compared with `==`. The map value can be any type at all.
The order of map iteration is random _practically_.

Quoted string conversion character is `%q`.

A map is a reference to the data structure created by make. When a map is passed as an argument to a function, the function receives a copy of the reference. Any change in the function will be visible on the actual map. Example [code](./map/main.go).

The value of a constant **must** be a string, number or boolean.

Composite literals are a compact notation for instantiating any of Go's composite types, i.e., slice, struct.

A `goroutine` is a concurrent function execution.

A `channel` is a communication mechanism that allows one goroutine to pass values of a specified type to another goroutine.

When one goroutine attempts to send or receive on an un-buffered channel, it blocks until another goroutine attempts the corresponding receive or send operation. When the value is transferred, both goroutines proceed.

HTTP server runs the handler functions for each incoming request in a separate goroutine so that it can serve multiple requests simultaneously.

`io.Writer` interface is commonly used across the standard library. From stdout to http response writer. Investigate further and use it to take advantage of its common usage.

Tagless switch is equivalent to switch true.
The `default` statement can be placed in between case statements.
Case statements do not fall through from one to next. But there is a fallthrough statement that overrides this behavior. An [example](https://golangbyexample.com/fallthrough-keyword-golang/) for fallthrough statement.

The `&` operator yields the address of a variable, and the `*` operator retrieves the variable that the pointer refers to.
